            Scroll through any social media feed today, and you'll see a parade
            of photos, each touched up with what we casually term "filters."
            I've always been fascinated by the mechanics behind these visual
            tweaks. The day I understood the math and theory of filters was the
            day my whole perspective changed. In simple terms, these filters are
            just kernels. An image? Think of it as a grid, each cell filled with
            numbers that represent shades of colors (true for gray scale
            images). A color image has 3 channels (Red, Green and Blue) and
            hence to keep things simple, I will be using gray scaled images. And
            the process of applying on a filter? It's all about altering these
            numbers in systematic ways. Trust me, it’s not as complicated as it
            sounds! In this blog, we're diving into the basics – exploring four
            fundamental kernel types: identity, blur, sharpen, and emboss. Let’s
            dive in!

          The Identity Kernel retains the image's original form, making no
          changes when applied. One might wonder about its importance. Its
          importance becomes clear when realizing that the Identity Kernel
          serves as a basic introduction to the world of kernels. Through it,
          one can learn the fundamental process of kernel application, paving
          the way to understand more advanced kernels. To illustrate, here is a
          greyed-out, pixelated image of an apple:

            Here's an image that's 39×39 pixels in size. Every pixel in it has a value between 0 and 255, indicating its shade. A value closer to 0 means it's more black, while 255 indicates it's white. Here are the pixel values for this image:

            Let's break down the Identity Kernel. Start with a segment of an image, represented by a 6×6 matrix. Focus on the top-left 3×3 subset of this matrix. The Identity Kernel itself is a 3×3 matrix, distinguished by its center value of one, while every other value is zero. Applying this kernel is straightforward: multiply each element of the 3×3 segment by its corresponding element in the kernel. Once multiplied, sum up all these values. With the Identity Kernel, the sum is simply the center value from our initial 3×3 matrix segment. This calculated sum is the updated pixel value for the central position in the top-left 3×3 subset of this matrix (within the yellow circle).

            Next, we shift one step to the right and repeat the process. Here's how it unfolds:
